# RFID-Tracking-System

This project allows the use of many wifi-enabled arduinos along with the MFRC522 RFID scanner board to create a closed tracking system.

Each bench is numbered according the the scheme C1-B1 to C1-B10, then C2-B1 to C2-B10, etc. Each bench has an arduino and updates the mySQL 
database each time a device is detected by the reader.
